# Throttle DOM Timers to 30 Hz on Foreground Pages

## Proposed Change

On foreground pages, execute DOM timers with a non-zero delay on a regular
30Â Hz tick, instead of as soon as their delay has passed.

On background pages, DOM timers already run on a regular 1 Hz tick (or even less
frequently after 5 minutes).

## Motivation

DOM Timers running at more than 30 Hz can almost always be replaced with
alternative APIs that provide a better user experience and consume less
resources, as explained in this
[blog post](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/timer-throttling-in-chrome-88/#workarounds).

Throttling DOM Timers to 30 Hz will incentivize some Web developers to switch to
these alternative APIs. At the same time, content isn't updated will consume
less resources, because timers will run less often.

An experiment on the Canary and Dev channels shows that this reduces Chrome's
CPU usage by 4%. No breakages were reported, except for a Speedometer regression
which addressed by this other
[feature](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5710690097561600).

## Spec

The
[spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/timers-and-user-prompts.html#run-steps-after-a-timeout)
already allow adding arbitrary delays to DOM Timers ("Optionally, wait a further
implementation-defined length of time.").
